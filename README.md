# A2-TicTacToe

## About Project
In this we will be tackling the algorithm of Tic Tac Toe. The game will have 2 modes: User vs User and User vs AI (through the use of the Minimax algorithm). Julie will be implementing this in Python using the Functional Programming Paradigm. Julia will implement this in Java through the Object Oriented Paradigm.

## Basic Gameplay
Tic Tac Toe is a 2-player game (User vs User or User vs AI) where the players are presented with a 3x3 grid where they each take a turn to place their token(either X or O) in one of the availiable spaces. The aim of the game is for 1 player to get 3 of their respective markers in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally). The first person to complete this task wins the game. If all spaces are filled and no winner is declared, then the games ends in a tie.
For further details regarding the game rules and the implementation of AI algorithms please refer to the report.
