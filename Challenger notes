Java is good so far with only minor alterations I would recommend such as having only 1 Scanner class instance instead of 2 since the same one can be used for both integer and String inputs. In the chooseGameMode() class however, I think the do-while condition needs to be changed from: while((choice != 1) && (choice != 2)); to: while((choice != 1) || (choice != 2)); since the loop needs to occur again if the game mode input was invalid, i.e. it was not 1 nor 2. The rest of the code seems good.
The Python program also is done well and does not seem to have any issues. I would recommend having a separate variable or Boolean for the gamemode variable in the case of a user vs AI game in regards to the AI difficulty, however it works just fine as it is.
